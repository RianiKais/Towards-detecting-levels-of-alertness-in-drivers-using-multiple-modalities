# Towards-detecting-levels-of-alertness-in-drivers-using-multiple-modalities

Distracted and drowsy driving are two very common causes of car accidents as they contribute to 2.3% of all the fatalities caused
on the US roads. Therefore, in the era of smart driving there is an increased need of technologies able to monitor driverâ€™s alertness
and provide timely alerts to the driver. In this paper, we conduct as pilot study and we present a preliminary, yet novel multimodal
dataset, collected from 10 subjects using three different modalities. Our modalities include a thermal camera, an RGB camera, and four
physiological indicators. The dataset consists of two recording sessions for each subject, thus, offering in total 20 multimodal driving
sessions. We propose a machine learning framework aiming to investigate the hypothesis that multimodal features have higher potential
towards driver alertness detection. Our dataset and analysis focus on exploring the differences between alertness and drowsiness
as they intersect with the presence of different distractions. The results highlight the validity of our hypothesis and introduce
interesting future directions for research.
